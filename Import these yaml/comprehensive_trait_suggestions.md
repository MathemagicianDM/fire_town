## Implementation Tips

### Using promote_if and exclude_if

For each template, consider which shop or location quirks would make certain descriptions more or less appropriate:

**Promote If Examples:**
- A "cozy interior" template might have `promote_if: ["intimate", "family-run", "homey"]`
- A "busy storefront" template might have `promote_if: ["popular", "central location", "thriving"]`

**Exclude If Examples:**
- A "pristine condition" template might have `exclude_if: ["rundown", "decrepit", "abandoned"]`
- A "luxury interior" template might have `exclude_if: ["budget", "desperate", "poor quality"]`

### Variable Usage

Consider these variable patterns:
- `{color}` - for flexible color choices
- `{material}` - for construction or fabric materials
- `{size}` - for relative sizing
- `{condition}` - for wear/maintenance state
- `{time_of_day}` - for lighting conditions
- `{weather}` - for environmental conditions

### Tag Conflict Prevention

Remember that tags prevent conflicts within the same description type:
- Only one `hair` tag per person
- Only one `lighting` tag per location
- Only one `storefront` tag per shop exterior

This system ensures variety while maintaining coherence in generated descriptions.

### Balancing Specificity and Flexibility

- **Broad tags** (like `atmosphere`) allow for general mood setting
- **Specific tags** (like `eyebrows`) provide precise detail control
- **Cultural tags** account for different fantasy ancestries and traditions
- **Professional tags** reflect the character's work and social status

Use this comprehensive list as a starting point, then expand based on your specific world-building needs and the unique elements of your fantasy setting!
