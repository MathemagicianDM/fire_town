# Complete Example YAML Import
# This shows how to structure a full import with both physical and clothing templates
# You can use this as a reference or starting point

# PHYSICAL TEMPLATES
physical_templates:
  - template: "has striking {ancestry} eyes that seem to hold ancient wisdom"
    ancestry_groups: ["humanoid"]
    roles: ["owner"]
    tags: ["eyes"]
  
  - template: "keeps {pronoun_possessive} silver hair in a neat bun while working"
    ancestry_groups: ["has_hair"]
    roles: ["cook"]
    tags: ["hair"]
    
  - template: "bears the calloused hands of a master craftsperson"
    ancestry_groups: ["humanoid"]
    roles: ["journeyman"]
    tags: ["hands"]

# CLOTHING TEMPLATES  
clothing_templates:
  - template: "wears an apron embroidered with {ancestry} protective runes"
    ancestry_groups: ["humanoid"]
    roles: ["cook"]
    tags: ["torso"]
    
  - template: "adorns {pronoun_possessive} finest robes with family insignia"
    ancestry_groups: ["all"]
    roles: ["owner"]

    tags: ["feet"]

# NOTE: When importing, you would typically separate these into the individual files
# (physical_templates.yaml and clothing_templates.yaml) as provided, but this shows
# the complete structure if you prefer a single file approach.
