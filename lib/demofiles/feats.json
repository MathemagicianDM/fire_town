"Prerequisites": [],
"Benefit": "You learn a new language, which you understand in all its local everyday forms. When you learn a language, you can partially understand other languages related to the language (including complex, scholarly, or archaic forms) as the GM determines. Starting Languages: A starting character gains three bonus feat slots with which to take Learn Language, typically using those feat slots to learn Imperial, the character’s regional language, and the character’s lineage language. A player can work with the GM to have their character gain an additional bonus feat slot to take Learn Language if doing so fits the character’s story.",
"Example": "A character who takes Learn Language (Ilvani) knows how to speak, understand, read, and write the common form of the Ilvani language. But the character would have trouble understanding nonlocal dialects of Ilvani, and reading archaic or scholarly Ilvani texts. A character who takes Learn Language (Imperial Sign) understands how to sign with that language as it is used in the area where they learned it. But traveling far afield into other former territories of the Empire might bring them into contact with slightly different dialects of that language, making it more difficult, though never impossible, to communicate.",
"Mastery": "You can take a first instance of this feat multiple times. Each time you do so, you take it for a different language. You can take this feat up to three times for a chosen language. Each time you do so, you increase your ability to understand, translate, or communicate in the chosen language.",

You can still be tracked by magical means, and you can be noticed if you are directly observed by a creature, downwind of a creature with the scent feature, moving noisily near creatures who can hear you, and so on.
